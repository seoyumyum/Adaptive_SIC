# Adaptive_SIC (Self-Interference Cancellation for In-band Full-Duplex Wireless System)
## Behavior modeling and implementation of adaptive self-interference cancellation 
- Wiener initialization utilizing expected transfer function.
- For cancellation path, it is implemented either in i) RF-domain LMS, ii) BB-domain LMS
